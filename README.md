# Haskell Calculator

A basic calculator implemented in Haskell.

## Introduction

This Haskell project provides a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations. It serves as a minimal example of using Haskell for mathematical calculations.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Haskell-Calculator.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:


   ```shell
   cd Haskell-Calculator
3. Compile the Haskell code:

   ```shell
   ghc Calculator.hs

4. Run the calculator:

   ```shell
   ./Calculator

5. Enter mathematical expressions to evaluate. For example:

   ```shell
   5 + 3
   ```

   You can also define your own functions:
   ```shell
   def:
   ```
   ``` shell
   F(x,y) = x ^ y
   ```

## Project Structure
The project consists of a single file:

Calculator.hs: Contains the main calculator logic.
